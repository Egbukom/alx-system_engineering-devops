Where am i, a script that prints the pathname of the working directory
What's in there, a script that displays contents of current directory
There's no place like home, navigating to user's home
The long format, listing with long option
Hidden files, listing with -a option
I love numbers, listing with -an options
welcome, make directory with specified name in specified folder.
